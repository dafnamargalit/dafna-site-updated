Welcome to the source code of my own [personal website](https://dafna.rocks)!

I created this website using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by Vercel, a React-based Framework that utilizes server-side rendering in order to create a faster and higher quality user experience! And the fun, interactive starry background that moves with your mouse? I used [three.js](https://threejs.org) to create that!

# Deployment

In order to deploy this website and host it, I used [Vercels's](https://vercel.com/) hosting services, which are free! What's great about NextJS is the deployment is already set up AND it's hooked up to your GitHub Repositoryâ€“ so each commit is automatically deployed once pushed! So nice and easy!
